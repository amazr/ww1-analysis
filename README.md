# ww1-analysis
Open the "ww1.Rpoj" file in RStudio. This will load the entire environment.
We do this because we wanted a way to simply include the PDF's that we used in
this analysis. If you put the PDF for his childrens children in the same folder as
the RProj file before you open it in RStudio the appropriate linking will be done
for you automatically. At that point, the code will just work :)
